# OpenWRT WiFi Access Point Management Tools

Use case: You already have a network with VLANS and you want to setup/manage wifi SSIDs for those VLANS. Use this tool to provision OpenWRT devices as wifi access points with VLAN segmentation and corresponding wireless networks, perfect for creating segmented wifi networks (main, guest, IoT, etc.). You will end up with "dumb" APs, with an IP address on management VLAN only.

### Caveats

- Designed to be used on fresh OpenWRT installations - **IF YOU HAVE EXISTING CONFIGURATIONS, PROCEED WITH CAUTION!** Please backup your current configuration.

- The script **disables switch ports** except for the uplink port. So if your device has multiple ports and you're using them, the tool as-is will not work for you currently.

## Tools included

### 1. **Backup Existing Configuration** (`backup-config.sh`)

Exports the current network and wireless configurations from all or selected APs.

### 1. **Network Setup** (`deploy-networks.sh`)

Configures VLAN network segmentation on OpenWRT access points, setting up trunk ports and VLAN interfaces for network isolation.

### 2. **Wireless Deployment** (`deploy-wireless.sh`)

Deploys wireless networks (SSIDs) mapped to specific VLANs, creating segmented WiFi networks on your access points. You must do `deploy-networks.sh` first to have VLANs configured.

### 3. **Complete Deployment** (`deploy-complete.sh`)

Deploys both network and wireless configurations simultaneously, ensuring VLANs and SSIDs are properly mapped across all APs. Does both `deploy-networks.sh` and `deploy-wireless.sh`.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **üì° Easy AP Management**: Deploy configurations to multiple OpenWRT access points simultaneously
- **üéØ VLAN-Segregated WiFi Networks**: Configure access points as dumb APs with VLAN-mapped SSIDs
- **üîÑ Coordinated Network & Wireless**: Ensures VLANs and SSIDs are properly mapped across all APs
- **üîß Hardware-Aware Configuration**: Optional optimizations for different AP models. Useful if you have plenty of APs with different models.
- **‚öôÔ∏è Three-Layer Override System**: Global defaults ‚Üí Common overrides ‚Üí AP-specific customizations
- **üè† Location-Specific Optimization**: Per-AP settings for different environments and hardware

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Complete Setup Workflow

1. **Define your network**: VLAN definition in `network-configs/vlan_XX.conf`, wifi configuration in `wireless-configs/ssid_vlanXX.conf`
2. **Configure access points**: Set up AP-specific settings (IP, name, location, optionally static IP, radio channel and optimizations, and other customizations) in `aps/ap-<location>.conf`
3. **Deploy everything**: Use one command to configure all APs

```bash
# Deploy complete infrastructure to all access points
./deploy-complete.sh aps/*.conf
```

## üîß How It Works

### 1. Deployment Process

1. **Network Deployment** (`deploy-networks.sh`):
   - Clears current network configurations
   - Loads base VLAN definitions and common network overrides from .conf files
   - Merges with AP-specific network settings
   - Configures switch ports, VLANs, and interfaces on each AP

2. **Wireless Deployment** (`deploy-wireless.sh`):
   - Clears current wireless configurations
   - Loads base SSID definitions and common wireless overrides from .conf files
   - Merges with AP-specific settings
   - Configures radios, wireless networks, and VLAN-SSID mapping on each AP

3. **Complete Deployment** (`deploy-complete.sh`):
   - Runs network deployment first (VLANs must exist before wireless mapping)
   - Then runs wireless deployment
   - Ensures coordinated configuration across all APs

### 2. Override Precedence

Settings are applied in this order (later overrides earlier):
1. Base configuration files (`vlan_*.conf`, `ssid_*.conf`)
2. Common overrides (`common-overrides.conf`) **optional**
3. AP-specific settings and overrides (variables in `aps/*.conf` files)

## Backup and Restore

```bash
# Create UCI backups manually
./backup-aps.sh aps/*.conf

# Deploy with automatic backup
./deploy-complete.sh -b aps/*.conf
./deploy-networks.sh -b aps/ap-main.conf
./deploy-wireless.sh -b aps/ap-main.conf

# Restore from backup with something like (example)
scp -O ap-main.20231215_143022.uciexport root@192.168.1.1:/tmp/
ssh root@192.168.1.1 "uci import < /tmp/ap-main.20231215_143022.uciexport && uci commit"
```

Backup files are created locally as: `{AP_NAME}.{YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS}.uciexport`
